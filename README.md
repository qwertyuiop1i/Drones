Overtime, the drones slowly become better at flying towards the green circle. Each generation, about 70 drones spawn, with their various control parameters being randomly modified. The drone that is closest to the green circle by the end of the generation is picked as the 'winner', and in the following generation, the drones are 'mutations' of that winner. Overtime, the drones become better at flying.

Click a point on the screen that the drones will fly too. Move the slider to change the amount of time that each generation flies for.

This does not seem to be working too well, the drones seem to stop improving after a short while, and remain unable to remain stable at the green circle. Perhaps if left to run for several hours, it could be decent.
